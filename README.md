A robust PINN approach is developed accurately predict pressure and flow velocity during the water hammer event. 
locally adaptive activation functions (LAAF) is adopted to improve PINN convergence and prediction accuracy. Moreover, an unsteady friction model with a self-adaptive coefficient is incorporated into PINN.
